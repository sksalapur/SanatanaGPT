Important DSA Concepts:

1. Time and Space Complexity:
   - Big-O notation describes the worst-case runtime.
   - Examples: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)

2. Sorting Algorithms:
   - Merge Sort (Divide and Conquer): O(n log n)
   - Quick Sort (Average O(n log n), worst O(n^2))
   - Heap Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort

3. Trees and Graphs:
   - Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, B-Trees
   - DFS, BFS, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Kruskal’s and Prim’s Algorithms

4. Dynamic Programming:
   - Memoization and Tabulation
   - Examples: Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, Matrix Chain Multiplication

5. Recursion and Backtracking:
   - Used in problems like N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, Subset Generation
